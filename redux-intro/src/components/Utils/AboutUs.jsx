			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to this humble corner of the internet (aka my final project for
				the frontend sprint) !{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				This project was proudly (and occasionally desperately) built as part of
				a <strong>Fullstack Bootcamp</strong>. While the code works, you might
				notice that the design is… let’s say <em>unique</em>. Or, as one of my
				classmates so lovingly put,{" "}
				<em>
					<strong>vintage</strong>.
				</em>{" "}
				That’s because design is not exactly my forte, and CSS and I have a very{" "}
				<em>very</em> complicated relationship.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you see a button floating where it shouldn’t, or a color
				combination that makes your eyes question reality… please, have mercy.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the day, this project isn’t about pixel-perfect layouts,
				it’s about <strong>learning</strong>, <strong>building</strong>, and
				proving that after enough coffee and Google searches (and yes, the
				occasional use of my lord and saviour ChatGPT), anything is possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for stopping by, and remember: if it works, it’s not a bug… it’s
				a <em>feature</em>. And, if its stupid, but it works,{" "}
				<strong> IT'S NOT STUPID!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Love,</p>
			<p>
				<em>Paula</em>
			</p>
